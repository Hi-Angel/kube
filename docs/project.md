# Vision
Kontact Quick aims to be an enterprise-ready PIM solution, that has a high-quality and rock solid core. The focus of the core is on high-quality code, maintainability, stability and performance.

We strive to keep the core to the necessary minimum, with minimal dependencies and maximum portability, and in a way that it is maintainable by a small team.
We also strive to keep the solution agile so that work by corporate partners can be executed upstream.

Experimental or advanced features are supported as optional addons, to not affect the high quality of the core product.

Kontact Quick aims to be available on various form-factors and platforms.

# Project Structure
While this is an open project that welcomes participation from everyone who's interested, we do have an explicit team strucuture to ensure it's clear to everyone who's repsonsible for what. External contributions are alwas welcome and the team is of course open for extension.

Team Lead/Maintainer: Christian Mollekopf
Team Members: Michael Bohlender, Sandro Knauss, Aaron Seigo

It's the team leads responsibility to:

* Organize regular online meetings (medium yet unknown)
* Give direction to the product and ensure it's followed.
* Direct development and oversee decisions
* Ensure documentation of decisions

## Decision making process
Decisions are generally made in discussion with the team, and result in documentation or an item on the roadmap. Non-trivial decisions are always either discussed on the mailinglist or in an online meeting.

Should the team not be able to reach consensus, the team lead makes the final decision.

NOTE: We should probably have a phabricator board for open decisions.

## Planning
All planning happens on the KDE Phabricator instance: https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/43/

## Releases / Milestones
Releases will follow achieved milestones. Milestones are assembled from tasks on the roadmap.

## Versioning
The product will follow the semantic versioning scheme (semver.org), with each feature release corresponding to a milestone on phabricator.
